== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

* JDK 9 or later
* IntelliJ IDE

=== Importing the project into IntelliJ

. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. If JDK 9 is listed in the drop down, select it. If it is not, click `New...` and select the directory where you installed JDK 9
.. Click `OK`
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Run the `seedu.addressbook.Main` class (right-click the `Main` class and click `Run Main.main()`) and try executing a few commands
. Run all the tests (right-click the `test` folder, and click `Run 'All Tests'`) and ensure that they pass
. Open the `StorageFile` file and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=java.xml.bind' to module compiler options`

== Use Cases
feature 6
As a CS21113 lecturer, I can entry students scores for each test and analyze the results automatically so that I can have a list of students who need my help and I will be able to focus on them more or give extra help to them.

MSS:
1. User requests to record the scores of each student for certain test
2. The address-book ask the user to locate(give) the input file
3. The user provides the input file for this test
4. The address-book starts to record scores
5. The address-book requires for the analytical standard (under what score or which grade)
6. User set the standard for analyzation
7. The address-book starts to analyse the result and list the student below the standard and documented the records.
8. The address-book asks the user to write some comments/notifications for these students.
9. user write comments/notifications
10. The address-book sent the comments/notifications to the students on the list
 The operation end
EXTENSION:

The operation ends
